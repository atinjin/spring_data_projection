# spring_data_projection
This is a example code of ''Spring Data Projection''.

#Why?
- If you need a different result with same object.
- If you have to create the more than two different result set.
- If you want to use a projection functionality without "Spring Data REST"
- You can just use a "Projection Factory".

#How to use
- Just see the example code.
- Just download the code and "Run 'gradle build'".
- Just read the my blog(http://atinjin.blogspot.kr/2016/04/spring-data-projection.html).
